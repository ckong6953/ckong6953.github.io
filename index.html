        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>Hi, I’m Chris! I am a second generation Korean-American born and raised in the Carolinas. 
            My background lies both in <span style="color:rgb(35, 120, 201)"><b>biochemistry</b></span> and <span style="background-color:rgb(0, 0, 0);color:rgb(35, 236, 35)">computer science.</span> 
            I believe that computational methodologies and techniques can be utilized in a biological setting to expedite the search for solutions to phenomena.
            At this time, I am looking at exploring such avenues in the realm of phamaceutical manufacturing with emphasis on automation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of work, my hobbies range from electronics (building computers and keyboards) 
            to photography (all the pictures you see on this site are taken by me!). Please feel free to follow me at the links below.

        <p> In my search to work in industry, I joined the Automation Department at Pfizer's Rocky Mount facility in April 2023. 
            The pharmaceutical industry was something I had yet to explore, and I wanted to learn more about some of the tools and techniques that are utilized for production.
            Primarily, I am part of an effort to historize and retrieve all data at the site using AVEVA PI System products, but I am involved on multiple efforts to maintain critical systems. 
            I am also tasked with understanding and being able to decipher various logical programs such as those found in the controllers utilized at the plant. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This continues to be an opportunity that I learn much from as I also involve myself in efforts to maintain proper documentation and good manufacturing practices sanctioned by the FDA.
            I look forward to working with various colleagues within the Pfizer network and learning something new along the way.

        <p> Obsessed with bridging the gap between biochemistry and computer science, I accepted a position as a graduate student in the Biophysics PhD program at UCSF.
            It was here that I was able to participate in some of the cutting-edge research being performed with a large focus on de novo protein design using computational methodology.
            I was able to rotate with Dr. William "Bill" DeGrado to learn more about this and how his lab approaches this realm of research. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the academia side of things, moving to the West Coast was a big transition for me. 
            It brought me to a very diverse campus and city that exposed me to topics and interests that I was unaware of or had no access to previously. 
            Ultimately, I realized that while the research was interesting I was lacking industry experience. Therefore, I sought to look for a position that would allow me to delve deeper into this.

        <p>&emsp; Being part of the Research Triangle, UNC-CH fostered an environment that provided an overwhelming number of opportunities. 
            From peers to professors, the campus pushed an interdisciplinary focus on education that guided me to learn, expand, and even challenge my perspective. 
        </p>    
        <p>
            The experience as a Ronald E. McNair Scholar in Dr. David Lawrence’s lab ingrained in me a passion for learning and research.
            Particularly, it translated topics I learned in the classroom to application-based approaches to biological phenomena. 
            I was involved with two research projects, with one being published in the Journal of Chemical Education, which you can access <b>
                <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.2c00096" target="_blank" >here.</a></b>
        
        </p>
        <p>
            UNC-CH instilled in me a passion for learning and inspired me to continue to think outside of the box.
